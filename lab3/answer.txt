Why did you choose class for ShoppingCart?

Because I want one shared cart that can change in place. If I pass the cart into functions or different screens and add/remove items, I want the same object to update everywhere. Classes in Swift are reference types, so this works naturally.

Why did you choose struct for Product and Order?

They’re just data:
Product is simple info (name, price). If I copy it, I don’t need changes to affect other places.

Order is a snapshot at checkout time. After I create it, I don’t want it to change when the cart changes. Structs are value types, so copies stay independent.

Example where reference semantics matter

In my code:

func modifyCart(_ c: ShoppingCart) {
    c.addItem(product: headphones, quantity: 1)
}
modifyCart(cart)

modifyCart adds headphones, and the original cart now has them too. That happens because ShoppingCart is a class (reference), so both variables point to the same instance.

Example where value semantics matter
let item1 = CartItem(product: laptop, quantity: 1)
var item2 = item1
item2.updateQuantity(5)

item1 stays 1, item2 becomes 5. CartItem is a struct, so item2 is a copy, not the same thing. Changes don’t leak back.
